# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The first player to mark three spaces in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main files:

- **index.html**: Contains the structure of the game board and winning message display.
- **styles.css**: Defines the styles for the game board, cells, and winning message.
- **script.js**: Implements the game logic and functionality.

## How to Use

To play the game, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Players take turns clicking on the cells to place their marks (X or O). The game automatically detects winning combinations and announces the winner. In case of a draw, the game declares it.

## Features

- Two-player functionality: Players can take turns marking spaces.
- Automatic win detection: The game checks for winning combinations after each move.
- Draw detection: The game detects when all spaces are filled without a winner.
